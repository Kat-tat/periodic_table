# periodic_table
A relational database in PostgreSQL edited according to instructions from freecodecamp and then a bash script written to query the database.

I had to amend a database provided by freeCodeCamp, renaming columns, adding constraints, adding foreign keys, trimming white space and capitalising the contents of a column. [Amended database](https://github.com/Kat-tat/periodic_table/blob/main/periodic_table.sql)

I then created a [script](https://github.com/Kat-tat/periodic_table/blob/main/element.sh) which uses data from the database to provide information on a given elements.
